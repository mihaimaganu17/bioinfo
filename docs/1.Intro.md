# Bioinformatics
Focuses on combined applications of:
- computation methods
- mathematical statistics
- molecular biology

AKAs:
- Computational Biology
- Computational Molecular Biology
- Computational Genomics

Types of cells:
- Prokariotes(no nucleus)
- Eukariotes(nucleus with DNA)

## Life molecules
1. DNAs
  - made of A,C,G,T nucleotides(bases)
2. RNAs 
  - made of A,C,G,U nucleotides
  - provide templates to synthesize amino-acids intro proteins
3. Proteins 
  - made of (20) amino acids
  - form enzymes that send signals to other cells and regulate gene activity

## Central Dogma of Bio
DNA -(transcription)> mRNA -(translation)> tRNA -> aminoacids -> polypeptide chain

Codon(triplet of DNA)
- corresponds to one of the 20 aminoacids
